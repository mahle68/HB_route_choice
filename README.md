Experience does not change the importance of wind support for migratory route selection by a soaring bird

Abstract

Migration is a complex behaviour that is costly in terms of time, energy and risk of mortality. Thermal soaring birds rely on airflow, specifically wind support and uplift, to offset their energetic costs of flight. Their migratory routes are a record of movement decisions to negotiate the atmospheric environment and achieve efficiency. We expected that, regardless of age, birds use wind support to select their routes. Because thermal soaring is a complex flight behaviour that young birds need to learn, we expected that, as individuals gain more experience, their movement decisions will also increasingly favour the best thermal uplift conditions. We quantified how route choice during autumn migration of young European honey buzzards (Pernis apivorus) was adjusted to wind support and uplift over up to 4 years of migration and compared this with the choices of adult birds. We found that wind support was important in all migrations. However, we did not find an increase in the use of thermal uplifts. This could be due to the species-specific learning period and/or an artefact of the spatio-temporal scale of our uplift proxies.
